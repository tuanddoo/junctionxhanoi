So basically this is a single page app built with React. You can just simply use npm to install dependencies and run the scripts defined in the webpack configs (in the root directory of the project).

Step by step:

1. Install npm

2. Go to the project root directory and run
```
npm install
```
this installs the dependencies.

3. Run
```
npm build && npm start
```
in the same directory and the app is available on localhost:3000.
